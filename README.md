Project Overview

With Moi University serving as a case study, the Smart Campus Network (SCN) project aims to establish a network infrastructure at Kenyan institutions and colleges.
By utilizing cutting-edge technologies like Software Defined Networking (SDN) and the Internet of Things (IoT), the initiative aims to improve security, 
increase resource sharing between departments, and improve campus connection. Techniques for gathering both qualitative and quantitative data, including surveys and interviews,
are part of the research approach. Using Cisco Packet Tracer, the network design, and simulation were carried out. The project's conclusion highlights the potential
advantages of SCN adoption in higher education while analyzing the implications for other institutions and suggesting additional research.

Documentation

In-depth information on the project is provided in the documentation paper, including a literature review, research methodology, network architecture, configuration instructions, 
and an explanation of the implemented features.

Project Files

The project files are provided in a zipped folder. After extracting the contents, you will find the following files:
Smart Campus Network.pkt: The main project file is compatible with Cisco Packet Tracer. This file contains the simulated network topology, preconfigured devices, and initial configurations.
README.md: This README file provides an overview of the project, instructions, and information about the documentation and project files.
Documentation file: Contains detailed documentation doc, as explained in the previous section.

Getting Started

Follow these steps to begin the Smart Campus Network Project:

The contents of the compressed folder can be extracted and placed wherever you like on your computer.
By choosing Open File from the File menu, launch Cisco Packet Tracer and load the project. Locate the Smart_Campus_Network.pkt file in the extracted folder.
Review the initial configurations and explore the network topology.
For comprehensive network design, configuration procedures, and simulation details, consult the documentation file.
Feel free to experiment with various scenarios, check connectivity, and track the network's behavior.
